Follow your interests The scope to focus on environmental problems and environmental policy in a range of sectors, including planning, food/agriculture, transport and housing. Transferable skills Develop sustainability-relevant research skills ideal for academic progression or professional practice. Develop your knowledge and understanding of sustainability theory, principles and practice and be empowered to influence and progress policy and planning solutions for the environmental and sustainability challenges faced by government, business and regulatory bodies.\nOur MSc in Sustainability, Planning and Environmental Policy addresses three key dimensions that will provide you with the skills and knowledge to contribute to future policy development and help tackle sensitive environmental and sustainability issues. We will consider:\nPrinciples and process - asking how policies may, or may not, achieve more sustainable development. Resource sector studies ‚Äì comparative and in-depth analysis of sustainability issues in key economic sectors (including food, transport, renewable energy and housing). Research training ‚Äì helping you to develop sustainability-relevant research skills ideal for academic progression, and professional practice. You‚Äôll benefit from teaching which links together theoretical debates about sustainability at different spatial scales, informed by the latest social science research around environmental problems, with the practical dimensions of policy formulation and implementation.

Breadth and depth Cover the breadth of environment and development issues or focus on select fields (such as economic sectors, natural resources, public services). Expert-led Learn from and engage with research-active staff who are working at the forefront of the discipline. Multi-scale exploration Examine lived experience of development and socio-ecological change across different levels and time periods. Environmental challenges and development concerns are high on the international policy agenda. Our MSc Environment and Development programme encourages you to consider the politicised interconnections between socio-economic demands (the search for growth) and environmental degradation, as well as the tensions between the state and society‚Äôs outlooks.\nWe cover a wide range of environment and development challenges or but you can also choose to focus on certain substantive fields (such as economic sectors, natural resources, public services, governance issues, environmental management or urban and rural regions). You‚Äôll develop your critical thinking skills and ability to examine the justification, trends and limitations of conventional responses to prevailing tensions and mounting challenges.\nYou‚Äôll consider the lived experience of development and socio-ecological change at different levels ‚Äì local, regional, national and global ‚Äì and across different time periods. With a focus on the Global North and the Global South, you‚Äôll study past legacies and socio-cultural influences, the allocation of resources, and the challenges to contain environmental degradation and foster environmental justice.\nThe programme allows you to: understand the ideological positions that influence development policies and the failures of environmental management; review tendencies to convert nature into resources and private property; the formulation and implementation of environmental regulation; the commitments and failures of the apparatus of the state; the interaction between socio-economic sectors, groups and communities; the social and cultural basis of development and environmental change; and, the political reactions, grassroots mobilisation and alliances across different geographical scales, countries and locations.\nConsideration is also given to why and how the development appeal continues to influence governments, social groups and international relations while generating uneven, short-term gains and long-lasting impacts. The limitations of policies influenced by environmentalism and narrow sustainability agendas, which commonly fail to address wider social, political and economic expectations, will be a key component of this discussion."},"title":"Masters"},"/masters/misc/":{"data":{"":"Random stuff related to masters"},"title":"Miscellaneous"},"/masters/misc/modules-envdev/":{"data":{"":"I was originally looking at Environment \u0026 Development masters but it‚Äôs not available part-time.\nModules for MSc Environment \u0026 Development\nDevelopment and Urbanisation Processes Principles and Practices of Environmental Governance Environmental Policy and Climate Change‚Ä° Environment and Development Research Methods Sustainable Food Systems‚Ä° Dissertation ","1-development-and-urbanisation-processes#1.

Environment and Development":" Semester Credits Code Spring 20 CPT917 International development is inherently carried out in environmental contexts, but relationships between environment and development are rarely addressed, which often dooms major development projects. This module examines the relationship between human development and environmental controversies through its unique focus on:\nEnvironment and development issues, which are framed within the context of international development, poverty alleviation and global inequalities. Issues of access, justice, participation, politics, capitalism and consumerism. The role of different actors (state, civil society, social movements) and the importance of scale and global interconnectedness, particularly when assessing the costs and benefits of approaches to sustainable development. The context of water is a focal area for this module. Through the module you will consider the politicised basis of ecology and the ecological basis of politics and the economy. The sessions are organised under a number of cross-cutting themes, including guiding principles, the role of the state, environments and resources, adaptation and knowledge. Within these themes you will explore issues such as environmental justice, biodiversity conservation, community participation, ecosystem services, urban environments, agri-food production and distribution, water politics, climate change, and environmental knowledge.\nOn completion of the module a student should be able to:\nUnderstand the interdependencies and politicised connections between society and the rest of socionature.
