[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is fantastic piece of software to read and annotate books and reports. 

I’ve been reading UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese's ‘From economy of occupation to economy of genocide  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967’.

It is **damning**. 

I‘ve been thinking about *why* the UK government finds it *so* hard to oppose genocide, and I think it‘s because the UK quite literally has a vested interest in Israel, historically, politically and economically.

And then realised, it‘s the same processes in operation with the nature and climate emergency.
