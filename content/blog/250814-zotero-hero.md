As an ex-frontend developr (building websites), I‚Äòm fairly technically-savvy, although I‚Äôd never used any reference management software before. 

I installed [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) a few weeks ago, after exploring the joys of publishing my [masters reading list](/masters/reading/) in [Cardiff Harvard Referencing citation format](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_4191#page1). Geek out ‚úåÔ∏è ü§ì. But what use was Zotero?

My daytime PC runs [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), and my PDF reader of choice is [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/en-gb/) -- lightweight, fast, with ability to highlight text. However, my tablet runs Android, and the choice of PDF readers is peculiarly bad and invasive (Adobe, Foxit etc). It was then that I realised, Zotero handles PDFs! Magnificent, and I can reference, highlight and annotate to my heart‚Äôs content.

This is the use of Zotero.
