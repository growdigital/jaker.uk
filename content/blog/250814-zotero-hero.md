As an ex-frontend developr (building websites), I‚Äòm fairly technically-savvy, although I‚Äôd never used any reference management software before. 

I installed [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) a few weeks ago, after exploring the joys of publishing my [masters reading list](/masters/reading/) in [Cardiff Harvard Referencing citation format](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_4191#page1). Geek out ‚úåÔ∏è ü§ì. But what use was Zotero?

My daytime PC runs [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), and my PDF reader of choice is [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/en-gb/) -- lightweight, fast, with ability to highlight text. However, my tablet runs Android, and the choice of PDF readers is peculiarly bad and invasive (Adobe, Foxit etc). It was then that I realised, Zotero handles PDFs! Magnificent, and I can reference, highlight and annotate to my heart‚Äôs content.

This is the use of Zotero.
### Addendum
Of course, there are other types items that you can install into your library and collections. They don‚Äòt have to be PDFs, they can be the title (eg of a physical book) and then you can add annotations to that title. I'm guessing you can also add audio, video, images, text files etc.

And then, for large lumps of text to annotate, you can scan a page of your book as a PDF, import into Zotero and then use the [Zotero PDF plugin](https://www.jdavidstark.com/how-to-extract-text-from-image-only-pdfs-with-zotero/) to transform the PDF into text selectable (you still see the image but also you can copy and past the text).
