Some people, like [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/) and [Richard Murphy](www.taxresearch.org.uk/), write *incessantly*. In a good way. I am not like this. I thought I would be but I‘m not, so I won‘t lose any sleep over it.

Instead, you shall be treated to random nonsense with #hashtags
## Skomer Island delights

Skomer Island (or as the locals call it, “Skomer“) is a nature reserve off the coast of Pembrokeshire, not far from [Milford Haven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milford_Haven). I was speaking with a Wildlife Tower pioneer (more of that later) called Wayne, and we got to talking about gabions, like you do. He said that there was a gabion retaining wall on the island, which the Petrels apparently love for nesting.

It is so popular it has been named the **Petrel Station**. #PetrelStation #pun

I had the good fortune to meet artist [Rebecca Kelly](https://www.instagram.com/rebeccawynkelly/?g=5) the other day. She was talking about her work, and this phrase really stuck with me:

> People and the land regenerating together

It‘s not one or the other, it‘s both. #artist
## Acetate sheet flower press
My friend Martin told me about a simple technique pressing flowers onto blotting paper using sheets of acetate and a rolling pin. I think. But I‘m not sure. I will post more when I find out. #flowers #WildFlowers
## Easy roast chestnuts
It’s that time of year when Sweet Chestnuts are roasted and consumed. My friend Martin (purveyor of Sweet Chestnuts in paper bags and probably tree form) told me that an easy way to cook them is in the air fryer:
1. Soak in hot water for 15 minutes
2. Cook in the air fryer at top temperature for 10-15 minutes

## Dangerous roads
In 2014, Swedish artist and illustrator [Karl Jilg](https://www.instagram.com/kallejilg/) showed how much space has been taken up by roads. His work [featured in Vox](https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/18/7236471/cars-pedestrians-sidewalks-roads) as well. The work is [available under a creative commons license](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-illustration-by-Karl-Jilg-shows-how-much-public-space-weve-given-up-to-cars_fig4_363558420). ![Illustration of a town showing the roads as chasms, with pedestrian crossings as planks, and people so very near the precipice](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1766959245/2014-jilg-sidewalk.webp)
