I have tried so many times a variety of todo lists and methodologies, from [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) to [Bullet Journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal). Where I'm at now is a shelf full of A5 dotted journals, using [Lunatask](https://lunatask.app/) as a digital bin and a headful of threads.

Yesterday I was at the launch of the [Public Map Platform](https://publicmap.org/en), which was incredibly useful for the Community Enterprise Agroforestry project I'm working on, and I was doodling and scribbling away. Not random thoughts exactly, more tangential, and I keep wanting to add them to a blog, with a minimal explanation, possibly with a hashtag, because it'll be interesting to see how the ideas could surface and reconnect over time. Like a subconscious intellectual patina. So, here goes, "Write summary yesterday's ideas":

- It is #time 
- Things #change
- A target #audience of one - focussed on delivering for specific people at specific times
- Who does it serve? - the 3 'rules' of #gardening
	1. Who does it serve?
	2. Where does the water go
	3. Who #cares? #care #management #maintenance
- It isn't #real - Around 1993, I went to watch The Word live in a #TV studio, on a coach, Bristol to London, and the audience was herded around like cattle, and there was no "vibe", it was all manufactured and formulaic, and I was disappointed (my Friday night entertainment when I was trapped at home post-uni) and relieved.
- Can you have #equality and #hierarchy?
- #CapabilityApproach [â†—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach) as a framework for decision making?
- #CommunityEngagement and #CountyFarm - people have to do the work
- Ping pong of ideas, bouncing from one to the other. #gloss as opposed to deep thinking
- Critical thinking and [Professor Freeman](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/news/2024/jul/tribute-professor-michael-freeman-fba) - at UCL I wrote for the student magazine and I glibly asked about his opinion on an article and he emphasised the need to research and think critically 
- #TV is shit, I have to make my own entertainment - I started watching an old TV series and I found it really *cliched*, and I felt that I ought to make my own entertainment, with my own characters. The kids are using Snapchat filters (demons and gods and goblins) and I thought it would be fun to do a solo mini-drama using the filters to create the characters. 
- "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" - where is this #quote from? #feminism? [Audre Lorde, 1979](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/audre-lorde-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house) #intersectional
- Othered #other
- Consent, always consent
- #feminism is for everybody - quote seen on #Mastodon 
- #hierachy, #patriarchy and #domination
