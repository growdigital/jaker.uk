Well, Iâ€™ve been accepted on the [MSc in Environment and Development](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/environment-and-development-msc) at Cardiff University, I have a potential mixed enterprise agroforestry site in mind, and Iâ€˜ve had some good feedback on a grant application. ðŸŽ‰

The name of the site is ==Recommoning==, because I think there needs to be a fundamental rethinking of how society is organised to tackle the nature and nature climate crisis.

> For a very long time, the intellectual consensus has been that we can no longer ask Great Questions. Increasingly, itâ€™s looking like we have no other choice

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) a lot for my day-to-day note taking and writing, so Iâ€™m using it to publish thoughts and organisation to this website, using the most excellent [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and the rather nice documentation and blog theme [Hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra). 

A big thank you to Doug for the stimulating conversations, which prompted this website because I wanted to put my reading list online! And a massive thank you to Antonia Malchik for all the inspiration from [On the Commons](https://antonia.substack.com/), helping to rekindle why Iâ€™m doing what Iâ€™m doing.
