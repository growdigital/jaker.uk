When I‚Äôm writing new notes, I like to use `YYMMDD` as a prefix, so that the filenames line up in orderly fashion. I know, this is a bit geeky.

I *was* using [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) to create a new blog post with the blog template, but for such a simple task, you can use the core plugin [Unique note creator](), which does exactly the same thing. 

You can even remap `Ctrl+N` to Unique note creator to create a new unique note!

Double gin and tonics all round. üç∏
