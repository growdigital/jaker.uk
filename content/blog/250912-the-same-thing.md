One of my favourite quotes from David Graeber is:

> The ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it is something we make and could just as easily make differently.

Graeber, D. 2024. *The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World, pp8*. 1st ed. London: Penguin

And one of my favourite books is Daniel Dennett‘s [Darwin’s Dangerous Idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_Dangerous_Idea), which for me is that the world is inescapably full of possibility.
