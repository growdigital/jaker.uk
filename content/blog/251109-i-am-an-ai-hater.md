Most excellent, here is a precis of the harms, which I've summarised and put in a list, cos why not:

"Critics have already written thoroughly about the 
1. [Environmental](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chatgpt-is-everywhere-environmental-costs-oped) [harms](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gy7lv448o)
2. [Reinforcement](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14) of [bias](https://www.noemamag.com/the-exploited-labor-behind-artificial-intelligence/) 
3. Generation of [racist output](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content)
4. [Cognitive harms](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/ai-eroded-doctors-ability-to-spot-cancer-within-months-in-study?embedded-checkout=true) and [AI supported suicides](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html)
5. Problems with [consent](https://www.404media.co/deepfake-harassment-ohio-undress-clothoff-nudify-apps/) and [copyright](https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/theft-is-not-fair-use-474e11f0d063)
6. AI tech companies further the [patterns of empire](https://karendhao.com/)
7. [It’s a con](https://thecon.ai/) that enables [fraud](https://voiceofsandiego.org/2025/04/14/as-bot-students-continue-to-flood-in-community-colleges-struggle-to-respond/) and [disinformation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080801/generative-ai-boosting-disinformation-and-propaganda-freedom-house/) and [harassment](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-artificial-intelligence-being-used-sextortion-harassment-2023-06-07/) and [surveillance](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/machine-surveillance-is-being-super-charged-by-large-ai-models)
8. The [exploitation of workers](https://www.wired.com/story/millions-of-workers-are-training-ai-models-for-pennies/)
9. An [excuse to fire workers](https://www.theverge.com/news/688679/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-efficiency) and de-skill work
10. How they [don’t actually reason](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) and probability and association are [inadequate to the goal of intelligence](https://thegradient.pub/machine-learning-wont-solve-the-natural-language-understanding-challenge/)
11. How people think it makes them faster when it [makes them slower](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/)
12. How it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative
13. How it is at its core a [fascist technology](https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/) rooted in the [ideology of supremacy](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/toolmen), defined not by its technical features but [by its political ones](https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/defining-ai)."

Fuck yeah
