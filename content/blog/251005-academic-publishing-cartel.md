Love this post about collective action and academic publishing by Cory Doctorow:
[MIT libraries are thriving without Elsevier](https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/16/the-public-sphere/#not-the-elsevier) 
> The academic publishing cartel insists that the millions it extracts from academic institutions and the billions it reaps in profit are all in service to serving as neutral, rigorous gatekeepers who ensure that only the best scholarship makes it into print. This is flatly untrue.

Also, I had an idea for the Sustainable Transport assessment, to look at flood risk, travel time and rail cost. Â£5 for 10 minutes. Look at all the options: walk, cycle, bus, train, car.
