In my day job I said I would put everyone’s meta-tasks into a [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart). Not too hard, I thought. There is a whole [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-esque language and Obsidian plugin called [Markwhen](https://github.com/mark-when/obsidian-plugin) but jeez, is it ever overkill. 

So, I’m back to Excel, and I *really* don‘t like Microsoft products, particularly the online Office365.
