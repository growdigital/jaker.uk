I’m a huge fan of [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)), a federated, Open Source social media network, made up of a federation of instances (servers). 

I just moved to a new instance, as I’m not really doing #ForestGarden design for a living any more, and I moved to [c.im](https://c.im), because I am a sucker for short names and because the übercool [Radical Anthropology](https://c.im/@RadicalAnthro/) has an account there.

One feature I haven’t used for a while is publishing blog posts to Mastodon. There is a service called [MastoFeed](https://mastofeed.org/) which seems to do the trick. This is a blog post to find out!!
