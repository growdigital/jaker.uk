## [Wellbeing of Future Generations Act 2015](https://futuregenerations.wales/)
My summary of the goals, ways of working and pillars. 
### 7 goals for Wales
1. Globally responsible  
2. Prosperous  
3. Resilient  
4. Healthier  
5. More equal  
6. Cohesive communities  
7. Vibrant culture and thriving Welsh language
### 5 ways of working
1. **The long term** - Avoiding short-termism and considering how decisions will impact on the well-being of future as well as current generations.  
2. **Prevention** - How acting early–and with others–to tackle  the root cause of problems before they arise or get worse can bring about better outcomes for individuals, public bodies and society as a whole.  
3. **Integration** - Ensuring that the full range of consequences of an action are considered so that activity in one area of work can be shaped to complement, rather than undermines, the activities in others.  
4. **Collaboration** - Working with others, both from within or outside your team or organisation, so that as many objectives as possible can be met with the resources and expertise available.  
5. **Involvement** - Not trying to solve problems alone but understanding the benefits of involving as wide a range of people as possible in helping shape the decisions and services that will affect their lives.
