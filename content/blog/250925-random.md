Most days I’m confronted with a barrage of ideas, so much input. And mostly random.

No.1, The Salt Professor. Ages ago, I listened Jim Al-Khalili’s [The Life Scientific](), and there was [an episode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b08n2ltq) with a professor who had dedicated his life to reducing the amount of salt in people‘s diets. His name is [Graham Macgregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_MacGregor), and I just found out he died 4 weeks ago. His work has saved thousands of lives.

Another thought that surfaced was a true story about a man in the 1930s who decided to escape from modern life and lived on a deserted island in the Pacific, only for it to become a key strategic site in the Pacific theatre in World War II.

The tragedy, not of the commons, but of capital accumulation.
