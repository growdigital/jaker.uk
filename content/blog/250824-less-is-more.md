I’ve started [reading](/reading/) for my SPEP, and practising my acronyms, always a useful skill for academia. SPEP stands for [Sustainable Planning & Environmental Policy](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/sustainability,-planning-and-environmental-policy-msc-part-time). Past few years I‘ve been focussed on the nature and climate emergency we‘re at the beginning of, and I was a bit worried that planning and environmental policy aren‘t really focussing on the systemic failings of capitalism. 

And then I remembered [Jason Hickel](https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more).

Degrowth **and** sustainable development, they go hand in hand.
