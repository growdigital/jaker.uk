Web designer in a previous life.

> Capitalism’s grow-or-die imperative stands radically at odds with ecology’s imperative of interdependence and limit. The two imperatives can no longer coexist with each other; nor can any society founded on the myth that they can be reconciled hope to survive. Either we will establish an ecological society or society will go under for everyone

## About the website
This is somewhere I can post notes about my work and random shit.

Built using the incredible [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, using the rather nice [Hextra theme](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) with [Heroicons](https://v1.heroicons.com/) (plus [extra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/shortcodes/icon/)). Content created with the mighty [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) using the [Typewriter theme](https://github.com/crashmoney/obsidian-typewriter) and these super useful community plugins:
1. [~~Better Word Count~~](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=better-word-count) (built-in to Typewriter theme)
