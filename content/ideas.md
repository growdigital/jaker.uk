I have lots of random yet related ideas. I never really know what to do with them, so I thought Iâ€˜d start a list. In no particular order (apart from the date, which is some sort of order):
- Mon  8 Sep 2025
	- Capitalism is inherently undemocratic (h/t Jason Hickel)
	- My next project is all about Ecology, Education & Agroforestry
	- How useful is hierarchy? Why hierarchy rather than organisation? Can you enforce flat level organisation?
- Mon 25 Aug 2025
	- Book idea. Degrowth: a manual
- Sat 23 Aug 2025
	- If you are poor, there is less margin for error
- Thu 21 Aug 2025
	- Industrial technological colonialism. Is colonialism practised around world across the ages different, only distinguished by advances in technology, and we just happen to have landed on western colonialism
- Fri 8 Aug 2025
	- Who has the authority?
	- Authority as systemised power
	- A visceral morality?
- Thu 7 Aug 2025
	- What even is development? Discussion with health worker from Swansea about money spent on student accommodation and not much else. Targetted development. HTML analogy: all frameworks deliver is simple HTML. Gardening analogy: plants in the ground.
