The module focuses on development and urbanisation. It pays particular attention to development problems faced by developing countries as well as to urbanisation processes. We focus on both problems and potential policies that have either been tested or could be tested. We cover a number of topics, such as for example, gender equality, female neglect, health and education, or the problems of the mega-cities and urban sprawl.

On completion of the module a student should be able to critically discuss:
1. basic concepts in development economics, such as economic growth, human development and the measures and indicators that have been proposed
2. the challenges of education, health and gender inequality in developing countries
3. the obstacles poor groups in developing countries face in order to access credit and insurance and the solutions that have been proposed
4. the relationship between urbanisation and economic growth
5. the challenges caused by the rapid expansion of urban areas in developing countries, with rural-urban migration as a principal cause.
