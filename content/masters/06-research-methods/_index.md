## 6. Research Methods
| Semester    | Credits | Code   |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| Spring 2027 | 20      | CPT926 |

The module is organised in two parts.  Part A provides an introduction and an overview of social science research methods and how research is framed, with an emphasis on planning, geography and urban studies. All students will attend the same lectures, seminars and workshops.

Part B provides a specialised examination of different social science research methods and analytical approaches. Students will critically understand how these methods and research ethics are applied and reflect on ways that these could be implemented in their own postgraduate dissertation.

Together, Parts A and B of the module give students a robust post-graduate-level understanding of the tasks involved in undertaking research in planning, geography and urban studies. The module is specifically designed to assist students in designing an effective postgraduate level dissertation.

On completion of the module a student should be able to:

**Part A** – in respect to research in general:
1. Critically assess alternative approaches to social research and to recognise their strengths and weaknesses. 
2. Examine the empirical content and relations of ideas introduced in other modules. 
3. Identify suitable methodological approaches for a given research question. 
4. Understand the epistemological principles (theories of knowledge) that govern the activities of social research. 
5. Gain practical guidance on how to plan, research and write a dissertation. 
6. Develop a dissertation project and conceptualise and plan the research process and its component steps. 

**Part B** – in relation to specific social science research methods and analytical approaches:
1. Critically understand how the methods taught can be used in their postgraduate dissertation.
2. Critically understand the application and challenges of different modes of data collection for research in their postgraduate dissertation. 
3. Critically understand the application of different analytical techniques for research in their postgraduate dissertation. 
4. Critically understand research ethics in the context of researching topics in their postgraduate dissertation. 
5. Critically apply skills in selected methods relevant to a postgraduate dissertation.
