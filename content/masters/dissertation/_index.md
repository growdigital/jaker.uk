## 7. Dissertation

The dissertation provides a student with the opportunity to independently pursue in greater depth a chosen subject or topic in the field. It provides the means for developing and expressing students' research and analytical abilities. The dissertation follows many of the rules of an essay (for example, presenting a coherent argument that is supported by evidence and referencing the material that is used) but it is a much-extended piece of work in which the arguments and evidence will be presented in a more sophisticated manner. In a dissertation there will be a clear account and justification for the methodology that has been used to collect and analyse data and the methodology will link to a rigorous conceptual framework that shows an awareness of current theoretical debates.

The assessment of the module takes the form of one written submission. As ethical and safe research conduct is a foundational element of any research project, the university requires that all students submit and receive approval of both an ethics protocol and risk assessment, for which pro-formas will be provided. Although both submissions do not count towards the final module mark, they **must** be submitted and approved before undertaking any primary fieldwork, as any data collected without these approvals cannot be used in the dissertation.

**In preparation for the start of this module, a series of workshops focused on the dissertation process will be offered to students during the taught academic year.**

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
1. Apply complex knowledge and skills acquired throughout the programme. 
2. Independently critically evaluate current scholarship and policy debates. 
3. Evaluate and critique methodologies and justify an appropriate research design. 
4. Evaluate and understand the ethics of the research and obtain the appropriate ethical approval to undertake the research. 
5. Demonstrate originality in the collection and analysis of data and its interpretation. 
6. Develop coherent, sustained and critically informed arguments leading to logical conclusions and appropriate recommendations. 
7. Reach accepted standards of written and illustrative presentation.
