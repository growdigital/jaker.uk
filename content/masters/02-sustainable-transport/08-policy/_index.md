## 1. Setting policy: working at different levels
## Policy elements

"A course of action taken by government to address the transport needs of its citizens"

Economic, social, environmental needs? **Who sets the needs?**

Wicked Problems - how we define problems defines solutions.
### 1.0 Process
social process:
1. consulting stakeholders
2. defining problems
3. establish goals and objectie
4. identify & evaluate options
5. etablish performance targets
6. measure impacts
### 1.1 Vision
*Vision* required. "Vision setting". Declarative vs imperative. Who sets the agenda? Ask the people. Who are the people? Social events 

Higher level agenda
- How does it tie in with other land use/economic/political policy? 
- This Town Needs More Artists
- ==That element in WelTAG== - where it's not just about economic activity
- Cross-department working. Future Generations Act - stipulations. Narrow technical, or wide political. 
### 1.2 Goal
What you ultimately want to achieve
### 1.3 Objectives
- objectives - a way to achieve a goal
- eg limiting car use, improving alternatives 
- find a paper to support your point of view! backing
### 1.4 Targets and indicators
- targets 'measurable objectives', have we attained objective?
- indicators intermediate level to indicate progress toward target
- define how things are perceived and what receives attention
- Note on targets
	- **Absolute** - set according to scientific derived limits to system functioning
	- **Relative** - set to improve existing scenario
	- **Targets** - set deliberatively to be meaningful and acceptable
### 1.5 Baseline/benchmark
- "existing, projected or reference conditions if change is not implemented."
- what are current trends and how might they be exarcebated in the future
- benchmark is more comparative analysis
### 1.6 Mechanisms
- "the levers we pull in order to achieve change"

Economic, Social and Environmental - Sustainable Transport ***Impacts*** (table)

Bring in literature at all levels, evidence all statements. 
### Eample of cycling
- In Denmark, urban planning and cycling integrated
- Jack - cycling book, not evidence based, 1980s, used by US & UK govts.

iterative process rather than waterfall? is this possible?
Calculate population of Cogan! 
Transport as medium for meaningful climate action.
## 2. Relating this to WelTAG 
WelTAG objective is goal, WelTAG option is objective and mechanism

==Look at report in Week 8 folder==
==Read Jacobs 2018==
"good process, bad policy"
## 3. Setting objectives WelTAG
- Gen national objectives Fututure Generations Act
- Local/regioanl plans
- ==Transport strategy==, net zero strategy - main document is transport strategy wales; all other policies have fed into this
- Objectives based against which policy
- **Vale of Glamorgan** - policy context is Cardiff, suburb of Cardiff but comes under 
- **Key into 7 well-being goals**: prosperous, resilient, equal, healthier, communities, culture, responsible
- Welsh Transport Strategy slides of our vision, well being ambitions 2021 ==check out slide==
- ==WelTAG 2017: social, environmental & economic== ==check out tables==
- How do you develop a long list of options? ==Read checklist==
- *Identify all objectives*
- **Make sure objectives are *cohesive***
- Show how you come to the thinking
- Original argument and back it up with evidence. 
- Isn't all academia cherry picking? Yes. So, is it 
- **Make value judgments explicit**
- ==Summary, read it==
