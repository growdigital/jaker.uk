### Lots of cars
- 85m new cars every yeaer
- 1.5bn cars over last century
- Every 1kg of car requires 5.3kg of raw material

- Between 30-50% is cruising for parking

what is quintile again?

- lack of access to car concentrated in most disadvantaged gruops
- air pollutants health impacts - poorest pay the most
- total of fatalities 20,000 EU 2019, 500,000 injuries
- 30 road deaths per million in UK 2100? 30pp a
