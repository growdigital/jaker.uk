- *Title*: Preliminary Site Briefing for Cogan Station, Cardiff.
- *Type*: Presentation
- *Date*: **Thu 13 Nov 2025**
- Individual, 15 minutes including questions
- 40% final module mark

Your individual presentation is an opportunity to research and present some of the initial context and problem identification required for the group report and to get formative feedback for the final report.

The assessment draws upon and aligns with Stage 0 of the Welsh Government WelTAG (Welsh Transport Appraisal Guidance) process: ‘Make the case for change’. The aim of the presentation is to describe the site, its current problems and who/what is most affected by the present issues. Importantly, you need to present the evidence upon which your assessment is based. In this assessment, you should not detail any options or solutions.

For the purposes of this assessment you should assume that your audience is local government and you are providing a briefing to them.

1. Briefly explain why the issue is important – this should refer to the key module themes of sustainability, accessibility and liveability.
2. Present an evidence-based description of the site. This will include details of the immediate and wider context and may include the topography of the site; current mobility infrastructures; travel patterns by mode; current and future socio-demographic, employment and population characteristics; density and diversity/ land uses of existing development; design codes prevalent in the area; walkability/ cyclability; relations to surrounding areas.
3. Identify primary points of concern using a proven methodology (e.g TfL Healthy Streets): what problems does the current site pose in relation to sustainability, accessibility and liveability and who is likely to be most adversely affected?
4. Provide a preliminary prioritisation of problems on the site in relation to the key concepts of sustainability, accessibility, liveability and justice. Which problems are the most pressing to solve given the need to improve accessibility, sustainability and liveability according to principles of justice?
5. Briefly outline the likely future situation if no action is taken to solve these problems and in so doing present the reasons why an intervention is required. You should pay particular attention to the effects of doing nothing on the environment, and the impacts on those who we would assume to have the poorest accessibility (e.g a focus on the distributional effects of issues identified).

Your presentation must be evidence-based and bring together secondary data on the site; observations and evidence from the site visit; and evidence drawn from policy and academic sources.

Given its relatively short length, your presentation does not need an executive summary or table of contents. However, it should include a short ‘methodology’ detailing the sources of evidence you have used to compile the report; make good use of maps, charts and images to visualise the site and its issues; include a list of references used as the final slide.

Each presentation slot will be 15 minutes, including 2 minutes for potential Q&A from the assessors. You should plan your presentation to take 13 minutes.
