**Place making - Cogan as destination**
## Policy context
- Objectives need to make sense in terms of WelTAG criteria
- **Strategic context** - look at ==Planning Policy Wales==
- **WelTAG 5 criteria** - use the criteria to assess your proposals
- **Net Zero Wales** - broad appraoch, not on detailed emissions
- **Transport Sector Emission Pathway 2019**
## Key problems
- List of key problems based on secondary data & site visit
- Add to list using your access calculations: what new problems arise, how are identified problems illuminated?
- Primary data, secondary data & third data (access calculations)
- BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CO-DEFINE PROBLEMS
- A problem is that we ==*don't know the problems without asking people*==. Methods for addressing this problem. How people *actually* travel
- Problem of *feedback* for interventions - iterative rather than waterfall
- The elephant in the room is climate crisis. This changes everything.
## Accessibility levels for different groups
- **Use 3 personas given**
- Range of activities 
- Choice of modes & routes
- Costs in time & money (& cognitive effort & cultural shift?)
- Experience 
## Problem mapping
- List of problems, evidence, cause and objectives
- Focussed on **personas** mobility, rather than geographical boundaries
- *Do this collectively*
- Use **Healthy Streets**
## Deliberation for targets
- Look for commonalities (stacking)
- Use car as benchmark
- Straight outta Cogan - it's not all about the speed
## Minimum levels
- minimum acceptablel levels of accessibility
- consider destinations, modes, cost, experience as well as time
- Set Minimum Acceptable Level of Accessibility (MALA - another fine acronym)
- identify characteristics that most affect accessibilty
## Objectives
- General national objectives eg FGA

## Site specific objectives to general objectives
eg

| Objective           | Detail                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Localised objective | safer walking from Cogan |
| Module              | enhance accessibility    |
| WG Transport        | provide safe accessible  |
| WG Wellbeing        | celebrate diversity      |
## Options!
- What do objectives mean? Options!
- Details on mechanisms through which objectives can be achieved
- Finalise lisit of WelTAG objectives in relation to all problems identified on the site - put them in a *matrix* (template in week 11)
- Options come from the targets/objectives. And problems. 
- cross border collaboration - cardiff & vale of glamorgan 
## Questions
Are there any budgets? No!
What are possibilities of cross-discplinary working? "transport only one part of placemaking" - make sure relevant to site, and risks from working
Can we criticise policy making process as part of the problem? Yes, but need to take into account *audience* (ie local and/or Welsh govt). **Add iterative, participatory process**
"You can suggest anything but make sure your case is backed up and makes sense"
## Developing options
- *Map them out* -- ==see example==
- For each long list option include short desc, location, how option tackles problem, objective appraisal
- Jacobs report A483 Transport Study (week 8)
- ==Do 3 options==
## Impact assessment
- Broad, not usual level of detail. 
- Make sure basing it on sustainability (livability and accessibility) (do use throughout, as this is the module theme!)
- Impacts: social & cultural, environmental & economic (make sure categorisation is justified eg Litman 2011)
- stage 1 - evidence impacts qualitatively
- stage 2 - impacts of short listed options
- stage 3 - quantify relevant impacts in more detail (watch out for repeition!)
- Impact scale! In the week 11 template folder **ˋUSE > DECIDE > DEVELOPˋ**
- The 7 point scale of impact big plus to minus. 
- Bear in mind criteria for assessment
## Recommendations for Stage 2
- discount options that fail to solve problem, fail to meet objectives, have significant negative impact, impossible to deliver, involve too much risk
- and the opposite for acceptable options
- module themes of **accessbility, livability and er, I have forgotten**
- entrails refining the thought behind
- **Select 2 options**. And go into detail of shortlisted options.
- ==Highlight the new words in stage 2==, as will be repeating words
- Can add extra images
## Stage 2 outline business case
1. strategic fit
2. Well-being
3. Affordability
4. Deliverability
5. Managment
## Stage 3
- State option taking forward based on analysis
- May be shortlisted or agreed combination of them
## Summary
- Submit peer review form
- Format - ==see week 11!==
- ==Read uni AI policy==, have discussion in group

## Structure (see slides)
