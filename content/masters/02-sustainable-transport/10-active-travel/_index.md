- Benefits active travel
	- Environmental
	- Health
	- Economic - business case big for investment £4-19 back from every £1 invested (source DfT). Research Andrew Sacchary the value of cycling, cycle parking allows 5x more retail spend/m2 than same area car parking 
## UK policy
- England
	- Gear Change - White Paper 2020
	- Local Transport Note 1/20 - ==cycle infrastructure design==
	- Active Travel England 2022 - tying funding to schemes
	- Highway Code update 2022 - hieararchy of road users introduced. The most vulnerable users the highest rating
	- Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS3) has proposed KPIs
- Wales
	- Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013
	- Update 2021
	- Active Travel Network Map required for local authorities
	- Another revision - safety of women & girls, lighting, toilets, seating, delivering equity on schemes
	- ==Does this cover planning? ie requirement for active travel on new developments?==
	- Llwybr Newydd - New Wales Transport Strategy 2021 - 20mph limit (2023), 20mph by default, unless. 25% reduction 882 people who have been seriously injured in Wales. 
	- Active Travel Delivery Plan - evaluation of travel schemes. Emphasises importance monitoring and evaluation.
	- Lack of consistent and enough funding - active travel fund, setup? Do councils apply for it?
- Design guidance - no one size fits all (cos it's design). Consider how to reduce speed and flow of traffic
- As seen in LTN1/20 figure 1.4, if flow and speed low, then don't need special provisions for cycling
- Reducing traffic volumes - needs to be area-based, using Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, bus gates, pedestrian & cycle zones, school streets, one-way streets, no entries
- if can't do this, then separate cycles
- Cycle schemes should always look to improve conditions for pdestrians too. **We are all pedestrians at some point**
## Delivering schemes
### Key considerations
- **Baselining** - is the scheme desired
- *Site visit*, cycle, walk, different times of the day
- Gather key data: traffic volume incl % HGVs, speeds, collisions
- Air quality data (NO2 and PM 2.5 & 10)
- Demographic data, census data, deprivation
- Key Trip Attractors (we can call these KTAs) - schools, centres, GPs etc
- Severance features (rail track, major road, river)
- Audit toosl - ATE Route Check Tool, Junctiona Assessment Tool LTN 1/2, Cycle Route Quality Criteria Tool (TfL), Route Selection Tool & Walking Route Assessment Tool (both part LCWIP), Healthy Streets Check for Designers
- "...that's just the engineer in me, always the fun sponge"
## Design!
### Case study Co-design Claphma Common
- Filter trial, for cut-through road, Windmill Drive
- LB Lambeth ran a Commonplace online consultation
- PJA contracted to make scheme permanent
- See ==concept design development== (also the ==rose for Healthy Streets==)
- Topographical Survey, Ground Penetrating Radar
- Co-design sessions - how to do outreach? Can you measure outreach? Out of % of residents, users, visitors?
- Important cycle route, but also raise "place function"
### Case study Faversham
- MasterMap speed data from OS to gather speed data along length of road
- Signs & lines, road "stressing"? (colouring) for 20mph 
- Data on road speeds 20mp limit trial
- Face to face surveys x600 by 3rd party (population 20,000)
- Infrastructure plan Local Cycling & Walking Infrastructure Plan (why not call it Active Travel Plan?). 13% Commonplace engagement. 
- stage 3 & 4 planning a network for walking & cycling
- Idea of ==*ongoing process*==. Consultation (engagement) and monitoring (and *feedback*)
