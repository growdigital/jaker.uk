Regenerating people and land together : are Results Based Payments a gateway to flourishing landscapes and prosperous communities?
## Outline
0. Intro - environmental issue is species and habitat loss in Ceredigion. Global and national figures. Intervention is results based payments. example is from Ireland, applicable to Wales generally and Ceredigion specifically. Emphasis on building local skills and relationships. cf Sustainable Farming Scheme, also UBI/UBS. Questions of **how to measure**, Potential for cross-department and multi-disciplinary approach, eg with county farm lletyt46wpa, with college - educational, food growing, multiple local businesses. 
1. **Causes** Environmental issue. Bad. Intensification and abandonment farming. Extreme weather (temperatures and rainfall). 
2. **Governance intervention**: results based payments. Ireland as example. Is scheme in Ceredigion, very small school for Priority Habitats. Question of measuring.  Metrics. Trad schemes a bit shite, despite the vast sums of money. **Aims** - holistic, with economic and livelhood. Flexible, adaptable, customisable for different situations. And also in face of climate crisis, creating resilience and also tackling the key issues. Think globally, act locally. Philosophical underpinning. Problem with Cost Benefit Analysis. Problems with trading schemes. eg Oxygen Conservation and Ceredigion site. Problem with money full stop?
3. **Effectiveness**: cf trad agrienv schemes. Declarative vs. imperative. Efficacy vs efficiency Money and value for money - UBI
4. **Improvements** make it not not so neoliberal? Capitalism inherently undemocratic. Control over resources. Property rights. The commons. Capitalists going to capitalise - increasing concentration of wealth and power. Danger to democracy. In conjunction with UBI/UBS? And direct democracy. cross-departmental, multi-disciplinary. Stacking: addressing multiple issues with "one" intervention. Has to be *long term*, not a couple of years. eg coppice. Local engagement, on the ground. Grass roots governance. Problems of capture (although arguably capture of centralised state is easier). Example of potential project in Lampeter

> The universality of geography and the specificity of place

Environmental issue: species and habitat loss in Ceredigion
Intervention: results based payments
Examples: Ceredigion, Wales and Ireland

> The first barrier to the success of AES and the delivery of ‘Public Goods’ is that of economics.

*move to low input*

1. What are the apparent causes of the environmental issue you are examining?
capitalism
2. What is a key governance intervention that has been used to address this issue?
results based agricultural payment scheme
3. How effective has this intervention proven in recent years, and why?
effective? at small scale for protected habitats
4. How could the intervention be improved, to make it a more effective governance mechanism?
tie in with other areas of governance. explicity policy of **collaboration**, **degrowth** and **direct democracy** - quote Hickel The 32%, cross-departmental, away from the silo, decommodification of essential services (food, housing, heating, connectivity, transport). enabled by process decommodification. Universal Basic Services. Food Sense Wales. Use existing structures. Project as experiment and 

business as usual is not working

think local, act global

**resilience and change - adaptability and flexibility**
Importance of *feedback* and also *metrics*. 
what to measure. value judgment. being explicit about value judgment. 
complexity

**efficacy** and **value for money** - see *ROI* and *Cost Benefit Analysis*

importance of social structures and *subservient* technology

question of knowledge. 

> There is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations.

cross discipline. 

When culture/economics/philosophy supports biodiversity

- local enactment

importance of local, investing in local communities, local knowledge and sustainable livelihoods

market liberalism *solely* about the price, leads to oligopoly and  and concentration of power (increase number billionaires)

whereas, create conditions for local businesses to thrive. 
On a very small level, Keep Wales Tidy uses plastic benches recycled from silage wrap from Swansea in it's packages across the whole of Wales, rather than 

ground up, grass roots

- habitat creation
- food production
- food distribution

>changes in land use arising from a push to increase yields as much as possible so as to maximise profit margins… capitalism is the cause of the Yellowhammer’s decline

> there is nothing democratic about capitalism

If only there was a way to determine [who profits from the status quo](https://www.forbes.com.au/news/billionaires/forbes-worlds-billionaires-list-2025-the-top-200/)? 

Metrics

connect policy areas
biodiversity - diversity of habitat & species - example of wood meadow - (Kull et al. 2003)

## Surplus
- **Market** - Only 6% fruit and veg grown in Wales (Social Farms & Gardens 2023)
- how many hectares under intensive agriculture in Ceredigion?
- silage and cow factories - statistics
- size and environmental impact of intensive dairy farming
- lack of species diversity. Handful of grass species.
- run off
- size of tractors, machinery not available for small fields with more hedgerows
- animal welfar
- robot milking machines
- John Deere - lock-in (see Doctorow)
- David Attenborough quote - separation from nature. suicide rates, mental health, Welsh farmers
## Case studies
- report Ceredigion "priority habitat"?
- Liz - mixed nature species grazing
- Lyn - quote re. organic & why not organic any more
- Ireland examples
- Pastoral association
- Role of agricultural education
## Metrics
- How do you measure
- Measurements irrevocably laden with value. *What* you choose to measure. *How* you choose to measure it.
- Optics. Post event justification. Using selective evidence and statistics to support your argument. Like, er, academia. Illusion of independence (David Graeber quote - The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World)
## Economic
- Pay people properly
- Alternative: Universal Basic Income and/or Universal Basic Services
- Conservation Basic Income
- Farmers Basic Income 

Food Sense Wales scheme. Work in collaboration for **surplus**. Guaranteed income from. Or UBI

**Economic** governance intervention. by removing food from the market
Clear objective: climage change & low input systems. **Local** food production, affordable. Fragility of international supplery chains.

sociological term "structuration" made up but useful. 
idea of Matteoli that societal level of attention 
## Technology
> He returned again and again to moments when societies rejected agriculture or technology or social hierarchy, when social groups chose what has often been dismissed as primitive because it was more free.

Franklin makes distinction between prescriptive technologies and holistic technologies/ Chinese bureucracy. Orthodoxy.
> technology itself becomes an agent of ordering and structuring.

==*Also* this is arguably change in governance style, decentralised.==
declarative vs. imperative programming

acculturation vs structuration

*Agricultural intensification & capitalism?*
