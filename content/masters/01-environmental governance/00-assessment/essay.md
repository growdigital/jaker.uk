# People and land regenerating together
## Are Results Based Schemes a step toward flourishing communities in Wales?

> Wales is now one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth… significant and ongoing changes in the way we manage our land for agriculture, and the effects of climate change, are having the biggest impacts on our wildlife… Wales’ biodiversity and wider environment continues to decline and degrade
> *State of Nature Wales 2023*

I propose that the underlying cause of this decline is capitalism, and will examine the idea of Results Based Payment Schemes as an envrionmental governance intervention that could provide a stepping stone toward an egalitarian food system decoupled from deleterious market forces, whilst enhancing biodiversity and increasing resilience to climate shocks.

Capitalism is an economic system based on the primacy of private property used for the pursuit of profit and the accumulation of capital by the commodification of everything, to the exclusion of everything else.

Industrial agriculture is a capitalist venture, leading to “changes in land use arising from a push to increase yields as much as possible so as to maximise profit margins… capitalism is the cause of the Yellowhammer’s decline” (Dean, 2021), where many of the fields of grass are a “factory floor – ploughed, reseeded, fertilised and sprayed with herbicide to maximise productivity” (Plantlife 2014). Simultaneously, agricultural abandonment also threatens ecosystems (Stoate et al. 2009).

But the ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it doesn’t have to be this way (Graeber 2024). Indeed, it hasn’t been for the vast majority of human existence.

From the seminal paper *When culture meets biodiversity : The case of the wooded meadow*, “Neither in any other community of Western Europe, nor anywhere in the tropics, does the number of vascular plant species within a few square meters reach the numbers counted on the Estonian wooded meadows.” (Kull et al., 2003, p. 76)

And critically “Biodiversity of the meadow ecosystems is connected to human use and it declines significantly if this use ceases.” (Kull et al., 2003, p. 89). The point here is that the right kind and level of human intervention in landscapes over time can **increase** biodiversity, counter to the pessimism of neo-Malthusians (Ioris, 2025, p. 15). See also Anderson 2005 and Graves 2024 for a cornucopia of evidence.

There is a lot of work to do though. 90% of Welsh land is used for agriculture, mostly for sheep and cattle (Neil 2022), and 50% of that land is “improved” grassland dominated by a monoculture of Rye-grass (Blackstock 2010), leading to a significant loss of biodiversity (Malisch et al. 2024).

Because the way that agricultural land is managed has been identified as *the* most significant factor in driving species population changes (Burns et al. 2016), and the fact that agriculture globally is responsible for up to 37% of greenhouse gas emissions (SAPEA 2020), agricultural land management needs to be front and centre of nature recovery efforts. As a counter-point, there does need to be a way to “make nature pay“ so that participants can *afford* to do the right thing.
### Result Based Schemes
In Europe, the “scientific consensus since Kleijn and Sutherland’s (2003) landmark paper, is that agri-environment measures have provided only marginal biodiversity gains”, so there have been increasing calls “for the integration of an ecosystem service approach into agri-environment measures and a payment structure based on the delivery of results (results-oriented)” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p.32 & p. 26)

“Result-based agri-environment schemes pay land managers not for performing specific management actions (such as mowing on set dates), but for achieving set environmental outcomes, such as a species rich grassland or the promotion of an endangered species” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 36)

Result Based Schemes have been enacted across Europe, with Ireland leading the way in terms of the number of schemes and area covered, and also analysis, specifically the anthology *Farming for Nature : The Role of Results-Based Payments* (O'Rourke et al., 2020).

Wales has just, in January 2026, commenced a new post-Brexit agri-environment scheme, the Sustainable Farming Scheme (Welsh Govt. 2026), which is action- based, as “Farmers entering the SFS must commit to 12 “Universal Actions” in return for entry-level payments.” (Case, 2026)

The biodviersity results of Result Based Schemes are very encouraging, “This collection of case studies provides proof-of-practice that results-based approaches can be successfully designed and implemented to achieve biodiversity objectives in high nature value farmland.” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 165) However, the phrase “high nature value farmland“ does call for some attention: it is farmland which *tends* to be not so productive and semi-natural habitats, rather than high yield areas. (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 38) The question whether Results Based Schemes can be applied to high yield areas is essentially an economic question, to which I shall return.

Even though Result Based Schemes are a step toward the decommodification of food, as it becomes an additional income for the farmer, what is interesting is that they are built upon the inherently capitalist ecosystem services approach. This “strives to commodify environmental public goods in an attempt to counteract market failure, which currently classifies them simply as free ‘externalities’” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 24), couched in the same language of finance as The Dasgupta Review (Dasgupta 2024). 

Nevertheless, “Result-oriented Agri-Environmental Schemes require a cultural change in the way farmers view the environment and engage with policy on the ground, along with a governance structure that is participatory and capable of adaptive management” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 14)

This gets to the heart of the matter, as it opens the door for a change in the *substance* of governance by introducing the necessary idea of a ‘Locally Led Results Based Approach’  “because in the delivery of LLRBA and nature friendly farming, one needs to build links between farming systems and the social and economic lives of the communities embedded in these places.” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 15). In the words of Carl Sauer, “Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result” (Denevan and Mathewson, 2009, p. 15), and it is only through the engagement of local expertise and vested interests that we can cultivate and regenerate beneficial long-term relationships between the people and their land. Wooded meadows can only flourish when they are supported by culture.

As well as a partial decommodification of food and the requirement for a cultural change toward local governance, Result Based Schemes also highlight the importance of education and awareness, both in terms of the knowledge of local landscapes and management, and the skills required for identifying the indicator species underpinning the payment system. “Without exception, all of the case studies considered training and education to be a crucial success factor.” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 283). This can key into a broader celebration and regeneration of Welsh cultures, such as *Geiriau Diflanedig—The Lost Words* (Amgueddfa Cymru 2023).
### Improvements
A useful analogy in comparing Action Based Schemes with Results Based Schemes is found in computer science. There is a distinction between imperative programming, which dictates explicit steps, and declarative programming, which declares *what* the desired outcome should be and leaves the implementation to the compiler.

By their declarative nature, Results Based Schemes already start to shift the balance of power in environmental governance through the mechanism of a Locally Led Results Based Approach, leading to greater community engagement: “The building of social capital – networks, trust, information sharing, along with acquiring new skills, knowledge and awareness - is vital in the longterm change in behaviour, attitudes and values required for the delivery of ecosystem services.” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 294)

There is a necessary tension between the universality of geography and the specificity of place.  


measuring
applicable at scale

at first glance, counter-intuitive, make nature pay
ubi/ubs

two fold: locally-led governance with expert support, and decommodification of food via the state. ubi, ubs



This used not to be the case before the advent of industrial agriculture, and there is cultural evidence from the mid-nineteenth century that 
“Farming itself is clearly not the problem, and government protection of nature is clearly far from a sufficient solution.” (Graves, 2024, p. 30) 

Aim is the creation of a permeable enclave, establishing the conditions for a micro-climate of economic and ecological stability.

Introduction, framing meaning of term flourishing, communities - looking at other species, land *and* people - culture quote, humans as force for good. but what are causes of species extinction?, looking at agriculture, capitalism (definition) (yellowhammer), RBAP as part of process toward decommodifying food, but reservations about commodification of ecosystem services. RBAP definition, example in Ceredigion as stepping stone, change in governance style. but applicable at scale? a tool and a. The necessity to measure? Can we set up systems that don't require measuring? direct democracy, trust the people. capitalism as fundamentally undemocratic. decommodify food more, food sense wales - paying extra, local food for local people. increased resilience, build up small businesses

There is a necessary tension between the universality of geography and the specificity of place. 

- Species extinction and habitat loss caused by change in land use and climate change
- Both these caused by capitalism - pursuit of profit and accumulation of capital
- Can have interventions at local level which ameliorate the conditions eg RBAP
- But needs to operate at landscape and societal level
- build ecological, social and economic resilience at local level
- Worm theory

- How do we measure efficacy of interventions?
- Interventions have to extend beyond the landscape, *cultural* interventions, with alternative models of economics and morality.

Ceredigion is a predominantly rural county, with a high percentage of farmland. And like rest of Wales, a problem with species extinction and habitat loss (figures?)
Trad AES don't work.
RBAPS seem more successful.
The biggest impacts on biodiversity are how the land is managed for agriculture and the effects of climate change
the drivers for this change are capitalism, ie profit motive and the accumulation of capital 
ng profit.

Capitalism is an economic system based on the primacy of private property used for the pursuit of profit and the accumulation of capital by the commodification of everything, to the exclusion of everything else.

In summary, you can say capitalism is the cause of the yellowhammer's decline.
Without going into the complexities 

argue that "Introducing natural capital into national accounting systems" does not deter profit seeking or capital accumulation. carbon trading example.

% of Ceredigion is agricultural land, and 

“changes in land use arising from a push to increase yields as much as possible so as to maximise profit margins… capitalism is the cause of the Yellowhammer’s decline” (Dean, 2021)

“Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result” (Denevan and Mathewson, 2009, p. 15)
if this is the case, then there has been a cultural failing *at some level*. 

Tending the Wild, Tir, examples of ecologically balanced living. But industrial agriculture

“Neither in any other community of Western Europe, nor anywhere in the tropics, does the number of vascular plant species within a few square meters reach the numbers counted on the Estonian wooded meadows.” (Kull et al., 2003, p. 76)

“Biodiversity of the meadow ecosystems is connected to human use and it declines significantly if this use ceases.” (Kull et al., 2003, p. 89)

This is not a technical issue, we know *how* to increase biodiversity. This is an economic, cultural and ultimately political issue.

## results based payments

“The scientific consensus since Kleijn and Sutherland’s (2003) landmark paper, is that agri-environment measures have provided only marginal biodiversity gains.” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 23)

“Result-oriented AES require a cultural change in the way farmers view the environment and engage with policy on the ground, along with a governance structure that is participatory and capable of adaptive management” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 14)

Critically, this opens the door for a change in the substance of governance by introducing the necessary idea of a ‘Locally Led Results Based Approach’ (LLRBA), so that “Result-oriented AES require a cultural change in the way farmers view the environment and engage with policy on the ground, along with a governance structure that is participatory and capable of adaptive management” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 14)

“the ecosystem services approach strives to commodify environmental public goods in an attempt to counteract market failure, which currently classifies them simply as free ‘externalities’” (O'Rourke et al., 2020, p. 24)
same with degupta (reference?)


but arguably commodification is part of the *problem*

goals: what are we trying to achieve
methods: what can we do
measures: are we achieving it

Results Based Payments moving away from subsidy for landowners, and prescriptive, paid for "ecosystem services". But is still the language of capitalism, . Possibly gateway to UBI for farmers. And then Food Sense Wales.


There is a necessary tension between the universality of geography and the specificity of place. 

> Our basic category of analysis is the totality of relations

action has to be *grounded* in place and “there are no places in the abstract” (with apologies to Erik Swyngedouw).

Guiding principles that are so vague as to be useless. How do we measure success? Species diversity? Centralised bad governance versus distributed. Networks of trust, importance of trust.

“Farmers entering the SFS must commit to 12 “Universal Actions” in return for entry-level payments.” (Case, 2026)
