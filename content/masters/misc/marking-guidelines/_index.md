| Fair<br>58, 55, 52                    | This report demonstrates a basic but adequate understanding of the topic, with some insight into objectives. Analysis is uneven and tends to rely on established ideas, with limited originality. Attempts to apply abstract concepts are present but basic. Independent learning is limited, and the use of sources lacks breadth. Document and field analysis are present but, with minimal critical reflection.                                                                       | The report's structure is uneven, with inconsistent use of headings, subheadings, and signposting, which can make the narrative difficult to follow.                                                                                           | The writing quality is adequate but inconsistent, with moments of clarity interspersed with sections that are poorly expressed or difficult to follow. The report demonstrates a limited ability to communicate information and ideas effectively. Use of specialist professional vocabulary is evident but often inaccurate or imprecise. The use of the word limit is uneven, leading to gaps in key areas or overly lengthy sections.                                                                                                                | Referencing and citations are present but inconsistent, with errors or omissions that occasionally undermine the credibility of the work.                         |
| Marginal Fail<br>48, 45, 42           | The report shows an inconsistent and superficial understanding of the topic. Key concepts are weakly addressed, and complex ideas are poorly applied. Analysis is mostly descriptive, and solutions lack depth or relevance. Independent learning is limited, with narrow use of sources. Document and data handling are basic and often ineffective, while field analysis is minimal or unclear.                                                                                        | The structure of the report is poorly organised, with little effective use of headings, subheadings, or signposting, resulting in a narrative that is difficult to follow.                                                                     | The writing quality is inconsistent and frequently unclear, making it difficult to follow the arguments or ideas presented. The report shows a limited ability to communicate information and ideas effectively, particularly to specialist audiences. Use of specialist professional vocabulary is minimal, often incorrect, or poorly applied. The presentation falls below basic professional standards, with inconsistent formatting and poor use of the word limit, leading to significant gaps in content or overemphasis on less relevant areas. | Referencing and citations are incomplete and often inaccurate, with errors or omissions that undermine the credibility and academic integrity of the work.        |
| Clear fail <br>38, 35, 32             | The report has major gaps in understanding and minimal insight into key objectives. Engagement with the topic is weak, and complex ideas are poorly addressed. Real-world application is inadequate, and proposed solutions lack coherence. Evidence of independent learning is scarce, sources are poorly selected, and analysis methods are ineffective. Fieldwork is either absent or poorly executed.                                                                                | The structure of the report is disorganised and difficult to follow, with little to no use of headings, subheadings, or signposting.                                                                                                           | The writing quality is poor, with frequent issues in clarity. The report does effectively communicate information and ideas, to a basic level. Specialist professional vocabulary is largely absent or used incorrectly. Presentation standards are well below expectations, with inconsistent formatting and failure to make effective use of the word limit, resulting in both significant omissions and irrelevant content.                                                                                                                          | Referencing and citations are frequently incorrect, incomplete, or absent, significantly undermining the academic credibility and rigour of the report.           |
| Very clear fail<br>28, 25, 22         | The report shows little understanding of the topic, with minimal or incorrect references to key concepts. There is no meaningful engagement with current developments, and complex ideas are not addressed. Real-world problems are inadequately handled, and solutions are missing or irrelevant. Independent learning is virtually absent, sources are few or poorly chosen, and research or fieldwork lacks coherence and relevance.                                                  | The structure of the report is incoherent, with no logical organisation, headings, or signposting.                                                                                                                                             | The writing quality is very poor, with pervasive issues in grammar, clarity, and organisation that make the report difficult to follow. The report demonstrates an inability to communicate basic information effectively, and specialist professional vocabulary is either entirely absent or notably misused. Presentation standards are very poor, with a lack of formatting and a failure to adhere to the word limit, resulting in extensive omissions or irrelevant content.                                                                      | Referencing and citations are consistently incomplete, incorrect, or absent, demonstrating a failure to engage with academic standards or conventions.            |
| Insufficient<br>18, 15, 12 8, 0       | The report demonstrates no understanding of the topic or its objectives. Content is incoherent, incorrect, or irrelevant. There is no attempt to apply complex ideas or engage with real-world issues meaningfully. Independent learning is absent, with no valid sources used. Document, data, and field analysis are missing or completely unrelated, showing no critical or academic engagement                                                                                       | The structure is non-existent, with no logical flow, headings, or signposting.                                                                                                                                                                 | The writing quality is extremely poor, with pervasive errors in grammar, spelling, and syntax that often render the report unreadable. There is no attempt to communicate information, with content that is disorganised, incoherent, and irrelevant. Specialist professional vocabulary is absent, and the report fails to meet the basic standards of clarity or expression. Presentation standards are unacceptable, with formatting that reflects negligence. There is a failure to adhere to the word limit or any other guidelines.               | Referencing and citations are either completely missing or are incorrect, thus providing no academic value.                                                       |
