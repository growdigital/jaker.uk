{{< icon "globe-alt" >}} Follow your interests
: The scope to focus on environmental problems and environmental policy in a range of sectors, including planning, food/agriculture, transport and housing.

{{< icon "badge-check" >}} Transferable skills
: Develop sustainability-relevant research skills ideal for academic progression or professional practice.

Develop your knowledge and understanding of sustainability theory, principles and practice and be empowered to influence and progress policy and planning solutions for the environmental and sustainability challenges faced by government, business and regulatory bodies.

Our MSc in Sustainability, Planning and Environmental Policy addresses three key dimensions that will provide you with the skills and knowledge to contribute to future policy development and help tackle sensitive environmental and sustainability issues. We will consider:
1. **Principles and process** - asking how policies may, or may not, achieve more sustainable development.
2. **Resource sector studies** – comparative and in-depth analysis of sustainability issues in key economic sectors (including food, transport, renewable energy and housing).
3. **Research training** – helping you to develop sustainability-relevant research skills ideal for academic progression, and professional practice.

You’ll benefit from teaching which links together theoretical debates about sustainability at different spatial scales, informed by the latest social science research around environmental problems, with the practical dimensions of policy formulation and implementation. The planning system is given particular attention because it provides one of the most sophisticated contemporary mechanisms for regulating environmental change.
### Course structure
Part-time normally 2 years (may be extended to 3). Divided into two parts:
1. **Part one** comprises a teaching programme of core and optional modules over four semesters.
2. **Part two** comprises an individual dissertation on a topic selected you will select in consultation with members of staff. Whilst there are few constraints on the choice of topic, it must address the core course themes of sustainability, environmental policy and planning.
