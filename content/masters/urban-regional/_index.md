`‡`This module explores the key concepts, thinkers and theories of uneven spatial development. The module addresses some of the most urgent questions in urban and regional economic development today. Why are some firms and places more creative, more dynamic and more innovative than others? Does globalization spell the “death of distance” and the “end of geography” as some theorist claim? Alternatively, is the clustering of economic activity a sign that geographical proximity (face-to-face contact) remains an important feature of knowledge exchange and trust-building despite the growth of distance-shrinking technologies like the internet? How are urban and regional areas tied into the global economy? What is the relationship between urban and regional development and the environment? Why are social inequalities intrinsic to urban economies? Drawing on these concepts and theories, the module examines the strategies of actual cities, regions and city-regions in the world economy to assess if these ideas help us to better understand why some places are more dynamic than others.

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
1. Demonstrate a critical understanding of theoretical debates on contemporary urban and regional economic development processes, and geographical patterns of uneven economic development.
2. Understand and show the extent to which economic development is embedded in urban and regional social and cultural contexts.
3. Critically evaluate the role of public policy in either fostering or frustrating urban and regional economic development.
Appreciate the scope for/barriers to urban and regional state action in fostering economic development and addressing economic decline.
