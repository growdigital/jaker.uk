This module considers the complexities involved in meeting societyâ€™s mobility needs whilst minimising negative impacts associated with surface transport.

The module has four main foci:
1. Understanding the environmental, social and economic impacts of different transport modes;
2. Identifying and evaluating the efficacy of different modes, mechanisms and methodologies to solve problems of accessibility;
3. Exploring the social, environmental and distributional consequences of different behavioural, spatial and technological solutions for achieving more sustainable transport;
4. Introducing the process of transport appraisal and scheme development.

In addressing 1,2 and 4, the module provides an overview of the UK transport policy landscape; introduces the main social and environmental externalities associated with surface transport; outlines the process of policy formation and transport project evaluation in the UK (specifically Welsh) context; and critically considers methods for engaging publics and measuring accessibility.

In addressing the third, policies adopted (both in the UK and internationally) for promoting sustainable mobility are evaluated, key challenges identified and innovative ideas to overcome the challenges discussed and explored.

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
1. Define and critically assess the main environmental, social and economic impacts of a range of surface transport modes and spatial arrangements within wider issues of economic growth and accumulation
2. Identify and implement key components of transport project appraisal in relation to achieving sustainability, liveability and accessibility.
3. Assess the social, environmental and distributional impacts of a range of sustainable transport policies and mode choices.
4. Critically examine the efficacy of contemporary solutions in a range of contexts.
