The aim of the report is to evaluate, from a distributional perspective, the existing problems and potential contribution of different solutions to enhancing the accessibility, liveability and sustainability of mobility in the Cogan site area.

The report should encompass the stages 1-3 of WelTAG: Strategic outline case; Outline business case and Full business case. However, most weight should be given to Stage one (summary of context and problem identification, development of a list of options) and Stage two (selection of preferred options). As such the group report allows you to include elements of your individual presentations to provide context. Your report should show that you are following a logical, deliberative, and evidence-based process and include the following:

1. Provide an assessment of the site regarding existing movement patterns, spatial arrangement, land use, density, demographics etc.
2. Identify the key problems generated by movement in the area; the main causes and who experiences them most acutely.
3. Provide an overview of differential levels of access for people living in Cogan based upon accessibility calculations relating to different example social groups, residential locations and journey purposes.
4. Based upon your evaluation of the site and existing access, identify a set of objectives and mechanisms to remedy the problems identified. The links between your objectives, mechanisms and accessibility calculations should be clear and embedded in established evidence on the impacts of different sustainable transport measures.
5. Produce a long list of options (3-4 options is appropriate for the length of the report). For each option provide:
    
    - description of the option
    - explanation of the mechanisms by which the option would address the problem, prevent the problem from getting worse or occurring in the first place
    - the likely social and cultural, environmental and economic impacts of each option, with sufficient detail to rule out options and to allow for the selection of a short list of options for further consideration
    - Key issues and potential ‘deal breakers’ related to the option
6. Critically assess and prioritise your list of options (using appropriate academic and policy sources) and discuss the potential contribution of two preferred options to enhancing the accessibility, liveability and sustainability of those identified as having poor access. Appraisal of options to be taken forward should be based on:
    
    - their ability to solve the problems identified
    - their ability to meet the objectives set
    - their short and longer term impacts
    - their deliverability
    - their robustness to uncertainty
7. Include an acknowledgement of the existing policy context (strategic case); and awareness of the other four components of the five criteria model (well-being; delivery; financial; commercial) in relation to each final option.

Note that you can and should use the evidence and analysis from the first assessment (individual presentation) to inform the early sections of the group report. However, you should ensure that this reflects the work of all group members and does not self-plagiarise – e.g you need to significantly re-phrase discussions from the individual presentation for inclusion in the group report.
